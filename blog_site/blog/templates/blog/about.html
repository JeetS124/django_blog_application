                        My AeroGarden hydroponic garden sits on the countertop in my house. You might think that would
                        mean
                        it would never have bugs on it, but you’d be wrong.

                        For some reason, my basil seems to constantly attract aphids. The first time I saw them, I had
                        no
                        idea what they were, and I had to do a lot of searching on the Internet to figure it out.

                        This morning, when I realized my basil had aphids on it again, I wondered if Bard could diagnose
                        the
                        problem. I gave Bard a simple picture of a leaf of the plant and asked it to describe what it
                        saw.
